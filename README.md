<h1>Task-6 : Prediction using decision tree algorithm</h1>
<p>This is the link to the YouTube video to see the solution: <a href="https://youtu.be/7MK5xImZjnU">youtube</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.</li>
  <li>The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.</li>
  <li>Data can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/3kXTdox">http://bit.ly/w-data</a></li>
